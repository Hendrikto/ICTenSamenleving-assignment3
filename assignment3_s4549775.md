# Introduction
In recent years the topics of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and their impact on society have become hot button issues. Specifically their influence on the job market is an often discussed issue, even though there are arguably more important aspects: Many leading researchers have long warned about the risks associated with AI [@ai_open_letter].

These discussions have often been overshadowed by an overarching problem: In most cases the concepts of machine learning, superintelligence, general intelligence, and artificial intelligence are thrown around without any clear definition of what intelligence means. A widely accepted definition is that intelligence is a measure of "overall mental ability" [@gfactor]. This does not really answer the question though, because it just shifts the question to: How do we define mental ability. Is there even such a thing as generic mental abilities, which is often called "general intelligence" [@gfactor]?

The goal of this article is to break down what intelligence means, and how it relates to current ML and AI research. Once we have established a solid definition, we can use it to properly talk about the (dis)advantages of some fields of research, the risks involved, and their societal influence.

The same problem which plagues privacy discussions also applies to intelligence: In the past, when talking about ML or AI, the discussions often failed because of diverging opinions on what intelligence is. If the participants don't agree on what the topic of their discussion is, it is very difficult to find common ground. Therefore the productivity of these discussion has not been as high as it could have been. We hope to rectify that with a better definition.
