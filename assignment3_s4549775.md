# Introduction
In recent years the topics of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and their impact on society have become hot button issues. Specifically their influence on the job market is an often discussed issue, even though there are arguably more important aspects: Many leading researchers have long warned about the risks associated with AI [@ai_open_letter].

These discussions have often been overshadowed by an overarching problem: In most cases the concepts of machine learning, superintelligence, general intelligence, and artificial intelligence are thrown around without any clear definition of what intelligence means. A widely accepted definition is that intelligence is a measure of "overall mental ability" [@gfactor]. This does not really answer the question though, because it just shifts the question to: How do we define mental ability. Is there even such a thing as generic mental abilities, which is often called "general intelligence" [@gfactor]?

Looking at the dictionary definitions of intelligence, we find multiple different versions:

* "The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills." [@oxford_intelligence]
* "the act of understanding" [@mw_intelligence]

  This is a very broad definition. What does understanding mean? If we look this up in the dictionary, it is defined circularly as "The ability to understand something" [@oxford_understanding]. And understand is defined as

  * "Perceive the intended meaning of (words, a language, or a speaker)" [@oxford_understand]
  * "Interpret or view (something) in a particular way" [@oxford_understand]

  None of this lets us really put a finger on what intelligence really means and does not help us draw a line between what is intelligent and what is not.
* "the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations" [@mw_intelligence]
* "the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or to think abstractly as measured by objective criteria (such as tests)" [@mw_intelligence]

We can ignore the definition "the collection of information of military or political value" [@oxford_intelligence], which is not the type of intelligence ML and AI are dealing with.

The goal of this article is to break down what intelligence means, and how it relates to current ML and AI research. Once we have established a solid definition, we can use it to properly talk about the (dis)advantages of some fields of research, the risks involved, and their societal influence.

The same problem which plagues privacy discussions also applies to intelligence: In the past, when talking about ML or AI, the discussions often failed because of diverging opinions on what intelligence is. If the participants don't agree on what the topic of their discussion is, it is very difficult to find common ground. Therefore the productivity of these discussion has not been as high as it could have been. We hope to rectify that with a better definition.
