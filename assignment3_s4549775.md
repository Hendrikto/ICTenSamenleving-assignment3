# Introduction
In recent years the topics of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and their impact on society have become hot button issues. Specifically their influence on the job market is an often discussed issue, even though there are arguably more important aspects: Many leading researchers have long warned about the risks associated with AI [@ai_open_letter].

These discussions have often been overshadowed by an overarching problem: In most cases the concepts of machine learning, superintelligence, general intelligence, and artificial intelligence are thrown around without any clear definition of what intelligence means. A widely accepted definition is that intelligence is a measure of "overall mental ability" [@gfactor]. This does not really answer the question though, because it just shifts the question to: How do we define mental ability. Is there even such a thing as generic mental abilities, which is often called "general intelligence" [@gfactor]?
